## System Description
Nethack is an old game where you walk in a dungeon and explore. Each level has a different landscape which is generated randomly. The objective of the system we are going to develop is to make a similar game where the map is generated by Twitter feeds. The system shall also follow a list of requirements.

## Prioritized List of Use Cases
##### Motivation for priorities:
We prioritized the use cases for the system according to.

* It an important part of the game
* The feature is an important part of the game design/idea
* The use case is connected to another use case
* Get an end to end as quick as possible to demo
* Influence core structure
* Involves risks
* Unknown areas that requires some studying

## Estimated Velocity Per Iteration
Each iteration has at most 80 points. Each point is worth one hour so 80 hours per sprint and one sprint lasts for 1 week.
